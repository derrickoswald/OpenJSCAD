OpenJSCAD
=========

Experimental version of OpenJSCAD.org.

Spurred by a [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)
demo of [ray tracing by Jonas Sicking](http://people.mozilla.org/~sicking/webgl/ray.html)
and the possibility of not having to convert curved objects into planar faces,
I thought of integrating the [OpenJSCAD.org](http://http://openjscad.org/) code base
into the [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework
in order to gain mobile portability and other UI benefits. 

Trying to learn:
* about WebGL and shaders 
* more about less, css, bootstrap, and mobile
